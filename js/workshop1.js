//Variables
//Let's create a variable
//What happens when we console.log a variable before we assign it a value?

//Let's discuss initialization, declaration, assignment

//Let's create a function to run with onclick attribute in html
//Write a function and define parameter vs argument
//Example for loose vs strict equality
//Truthy/Falsy example
let username = prompt("What is your username?")
console.log(username);
//Logical Operator Example
//age requirement

//declaration
let myString;
console.log(myString);

//assignment
myString = "This is a sentence";

//initialization
let x = 0;
